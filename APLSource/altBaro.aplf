 altBaro←{
     alt←⍵ ⍝ 12 bit alt field

     q←alt[7]

     q:1000-⍨25×2⊥alt[(⍳7),(8+⍳4)]
    ~q:0 ⍝ Sorry concorde.... (altitude is higher than 50175 feet)
    ⍝ if q is 0, this means that the plane is above 50175 ft. After a plane goes above this height, the height is encoded in gray code. TODO for later.
